# AWS CloudFormation Templates

CloudFormation is one of the Infrastructure-As-Code (IaC) services provided by AWS. This service makes deployment of various AWS Architecture very easy, efficient, and fast. In these templates, I've created some custom templates that create and configures the various services (which are used in production level deployments).

Here I've used the YAML format for ease of use.
